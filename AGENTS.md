## Specification Maintenance
* **CRITICAL**: Any time you add a new feature, modify a major flow, or change the architecture, you **MUST** update `SPEC.md` to reflect these changes.
* The `SPEC.md` file is the source of truth for the project's design. Do not let it drift from the actual implementation.
